# Portfolio Project

## CSS Stylesheets
*I will try to keep these to a minimum, making only more when necessary*

- global.css (fonts, colors, typography, common components between pages)
- index.css (the index page is unique from pages)
- portfolio.css (the portfolio pages are uniquely styled)
- individual.css (individual project pages are unique from other styles)

## HTML Pages
- index
- by_project
- by_medium
- about (about me page)

## Update Log For All Versions
*Honestly, this was not kept up to date as I forgot about this page, but I'll update what is about what I did for each version*

### Week 6
- I built out the majority of my project during this time because I knew I would get busy
- Mainly figured out how to make menu that can be shown when hovered on
- Tested out video compression
### Week 7
- Did next to nothing this week other than look at how to do what I wanted to do in JS for the random image sorting
### Week 8
- Crunch time here, I styled all the general sorting pages as well as dove into some JS
- Spent a lot of time working with the image "algorithm" and was pretty happy with what I got
- Made media queries for pages
- Worked on file organization for assets, etc.
