          Zhaojicun (Jerry Zhao) is a multimedia artist integrating photography
          with emerging digital technologies like interactive media. With a
          foundation in traditional fine arts like painting and sculpture, Jerry
          brings these classical influences into his creative process, layering
          together animations, graphic designs, and installations—projected and
          physical.

          These explorations have landed Jerry’s three-dimensional pieces in
          online exhibitions by institutions like the Museum of Contemporary
          Digital Art and Niio, and his art has been exhibited internationally
          at the Chengdu Contemporary Image Museum.

          York University, majoring in Photography & Imaging at Tisch and
