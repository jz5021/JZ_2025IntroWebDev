# Portfolio Project

## CSS Stylesheets
*I will try to keep these to a minimum, making only more when necessary*

- global.css (fonts, colors, typography, common components between pages)
- index.css (the index page is unique from pages)
- portfolio.css (the portfolio pages are uniquely styled)
- individual.css (individual project pages are unique from other styles)

## HTML Pages
- index
- by_project
- by_medium
- about (about me page)
