# Reflection on Wireframing Reading

> I quite enjoyed the reading. Although I was already familiar with several of the concepts because
I took a UX/UI class last year, it didn't hurt to get a refresher. I also thought there were
some interesting viewpoints that I forgot: primarily how people view things very differently.
I think this is the most difficult concept for me to understand. This type of realization only comes
when you're faced with a practical situation in my eyes. I also found the take that one should stick
to what they know and what they're the most proficient in for wireframing super interesting. There are
always new wireframing technologies coming out, so the idea that you should simply stck to a singlular
program isn't something I've ever heard before because I'm always being pushed to learn new programs.
