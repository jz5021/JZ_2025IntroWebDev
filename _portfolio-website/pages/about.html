            I was five, and the anatomy was inexplicable—but I remember the
            thrill when my parents recognized it. That creative impulse followed
            me into a rigorous, STEM-oriented Ivy League feeder school, where I
            thrived until I didn't. Burnout (and the pandemic) hit hard. But
            alongside chem labs and calculus, I quietly pursued art—attending an
            extracurricular studio program and earning an Honorable Mention from
            YoungArts for photography.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="paragraph-beat">That was a turning point.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In a deliberate act of rebellion—or maybe course correction—I chose
            NYU Tisch. There, surrounded by the creative energy of my peers and
            New York itself, my instincts flourished. My work has since been
            exhibited internationally, from the Chengdu Contemporary Image
            Museum to online showcases by the Museum of Contemporary Digital Art
            and Niio.

            The STEM-fueled discipline never left me, though. It led me to add a
            second major in Integrated Design & Media at NYU Tandon and a minor
            in Business of Entertainment, Media & Technology at Stern. Outside
            the classroom, I work as a gallery and digital media assistant at
            Bruce Silverstein Gallery and freelance as a photographer, producing
            campaigns for clients like DIOR and social media creatives.

            Lately, I've been shifting how I think about success—not as output
            or achievement, but as sustainability and creative clarity. I still
            work hard, but I'm learning to protect the part of me that started
            with that whale: curious, messy, and excited to make something that
            matters.
